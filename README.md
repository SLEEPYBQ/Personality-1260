# Personality-1260

This the official implementation of our paper “Rethinking Personality Assessment from Human-Agent Dialogues: Fewer Rounds May Be Better Than More”.

Specifically, we open-sourced the Personality-1260 dataset, which icludes 42 participants' interaction records with LLM Agents with different personality. Below is the brief description of this dataset:

Personality-1260 is a multi-round, multi-turn, dialogue-based dataset in Chinese designed to assess personality by capturing authentic behaviors exhibited by human users during interactions with agents of different personalities. The dataset includes Big Five personality dimension scale results from 42 participants (21 males, 21 females; $M = 22.07$, $SD = 2.32$) and records a total of 1,260 interaction rounds between humans and agents. Each round contained an average of 4.24 turns ($SD = 3.66$).

The full implementations are coming soon!
